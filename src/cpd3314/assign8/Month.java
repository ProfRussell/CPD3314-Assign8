/* Exercise #5 - Month Class
 * =========================
 * Write a class named Month. The class should have an int field named 
 * monthNumber that holds the number of the month. For example, January would be 
 * 1, February would be 2, and so forth. In addition, provide the following 
 * methods:
 * - A no-arg constructor that sets the monthNumber field to 1.
 * - A constructor that accepts the number of the month as an argument. It 
 *     should set the monthNumber field to the value passed as the argument. If 
 *     a value less than 1 or greater than 12 is passed, the construtor should 
 *     set monthNumber to 1.
 * - A constructor that accepts the name of the month, such as "January", 
 *     "february", or "MARCH" as an argument. It should be case-insensitive. It 
 *     should set the monthNumber field to the correct corresponding value.
 * - A setMonthNumber method that accepts an int argument, which is assigned to 
 *     the monthNumber field. If a value less than 1 or greater than 12 is 
 *     passed, the method should set monthNumber to 1.
 * - A getMonthNumber method that returns the value in the monthNumber field.
 * - A getMonthName method that returns the name of the month. For example, if 
 *     the monthNumber field contains 1, then this method should return 
 *     "January".
 * - A toString method that returns the same value as the getMonthName method.
 * - An equals method that accepts a Month object as an argument. If the 
 *     argument object holds the same data as the calling object, this method 
 *     should return true. Otherwise, it should return false.
 * - A greaterThan method that acepts a Month object as an argument. If the 
 *     calling object's monthNumber field is greater than the argument's 
 *     monthNumber field, this method should return true. Otherwise, it should 
 *     return false.
 * - A lessThan method that accepts a Month object as an argument. If the 
 *     calling object's monthNumber field is less than the argument's 
 *     monthNumber field, this method should return true. Otherwise, it should 
 *     return false.
