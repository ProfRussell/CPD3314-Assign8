/* Exercise #1 - Area Class
 * ========================
 * Write a class that has three overloaded static methods for calculating the 
 * areas of the following geometric shapes:
 * - Circles
 * - Rectangles
 * - Cylinders
 * Here are the formulas for calculating the area of the shapes.
 *   Area of a Circle:      Area = Math.PI * Radius * Radius
 *   Area of a Rectangle:   Area = Width * Length
 *   Area of a Cylinder:    Area = Math.PI * Radius * Radius * Height
 * Because the three methods are to be overloaded, they should each be named 
 * calculate, but have different parameter lists.
